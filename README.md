## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This gave me a chance to practice more JS especially with DOM manipulations and events.

### Continued development

I'm still trying to see if I can better optimise the code. I created a number of classes that turned out to be not needed. I'm hoping I can get better the more I practice.

### Useful resources
